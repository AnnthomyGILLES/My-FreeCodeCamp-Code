# My Work From FreeCodeCamp

This repository is not for an app but more as a journal where I keep a record of everything I have done and learned from FreeCodeCamp. I decided to use a wiki as I can put more information easily on it. You will find the code easily on the directories, and more information on the wiki section

I will try to keep everything updated. Please keep in mind that this started as a journal and so I have kept the code as it was when I solved the original challenges. This means that I did not re-write them with more advance techniques or improved on them but instead leave them as is until the problems are updated and they need thus the solution needs to be updated too.
